## 1. Executive Summary

## 2. Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to compare the remote data and real-time application services offered by Azure, AWS and GCP. Between the 3 providers, AWS is the largest provider known for its range of services and global infrastructure which a lot of organizations depend on. Azure is notable for organizations that are invested in the Microsoft ecosystem and from our classes we have learned Azure is generally used in the government. Google Cloud is great for services working with data and analytics.

## 3. Service Comparison

### A. RESTful API Services

Azure uses Azure API management for managing RESTful API. This allows users to publish their API's including REST and allow for managing and monitoring them. Their pricing model is in a tier system that starts at a basic consumption/Developer tier all the way to premium tiers.

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers or organizations to create, publish, maintain and monitor API's at any scale. Their pricing system for RESTful API's is paying for the API calls received and the amount of data transferred out.

Google Cloud Endpoints is a fully managed service helping developers create, deploy and manage API's for their applications. Cloud Endpoints takes care of tasks like API key management, access control, monitoring , and logging, allowing developers to focus on writing code. Their pricing system also depends on the number of API calls.

### B. GraphQL Services

Azure does not seem to have any native GraphQL services, it would be possible to use Azure API Management to host a GraphQL server. The pricing would be the same as above.

AWS has a fully managed GraphQL service called AWS AppSync with real time data synchronization. This service uses a pay as you go model with an option to provision a dedicated cache for a price as well.

Google Cloud can implement GraphQL using Apigee and their pricing model follows the pay-as-you-go model.

### C. WebSocket Services

### D. Data Streaming Services

### E. Streaming Analytics
